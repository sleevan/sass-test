sass-compass
============

This is a test git. The idea is to compile useful info on SASS/COMPASS so that when I come back after losing interest, I'll be able to get back up and running quickly.

I want to ensure I remember how to get ruby and compass installed and running, and create a library of useful files for use in projects that employ these tools.

It's also my first shot at github.
